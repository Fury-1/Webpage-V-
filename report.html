<h1>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</h1>
<p id="try">PCU value for junction Traffic flow is computed by using the Traffic Volume Count survey data. The peak hour is 08:30 am to 09:30 am which is obtained by survey. The peak volume per hour is computed, that is taken from hourly peak hours. The peak hour factor is calculated as 0.945. Then the volume/capacity ratio is found to be 1.7. Based on this value, the level of service of this junction is computed.</p>

<br>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p id="try">Junction has been analyzed by volume count survey (manual method). Based on the survey, Passenger Car Unit is  found and the Level Of Service is found by volume/capacity ratio. The junction has come under Level Of Service F, based on volume/capacity ratio. To improve this junction, some suggestions are adviced.</p>

<br>

<h1>SUGGESTIONS</h1>
<p id="try">Following are the suggestions adviced to improve the existing road junction.<br>
		&#8226; Increase the width of the road :– By increasing the width of the road, increases the capacity of the junction. And the volume/capacity ratio is decreased. Hence the LOS is improved<br>
&#8226; Improve the lateral clearance :– By improving the lateral clearance, the visibility of the user is improved. Hence it will increase the free flow traffic of the junction which results in decrease in congestion and accident rate.<br>
&#8226; By providing effective public transport system :- The private transport will be diverted with the public transports which enhance the free flow with high capacity.
